This project is a ride-sharing application that allows a user (driver) to create a trip by specifying an origin and destination with a time and date of departure. Other users (passengers) are able to request to join said trips. Upon request submission, drivers can either accept or decline the pasenger.

To begin:
1. Download this repo.
2. Run `rails s` from the 'backend' directory.
3. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` from the 'front end' directory.
4. Create an account, and begin browsing trips or creating trips.
